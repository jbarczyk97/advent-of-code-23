# Advent of Code 2023 in Rust

This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code challenges for the year 2023, implemented in Rust. It's my first time using Rust, and I'm excited to learn and improve my skills through these coding exercises.

## Project Structure

The project is organized by day, and each day has its own Rust module. Below is the project structure:

- `README.md`: Overview and instructions.
- `day_1/src`: Rust module for Day 1 challenge.
- `day_2/src`: Rust module for Day 2 challenge.
- ...

## Getting Started

To run the solutions locally:

1. Install Rust: [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
2. Clone this repository.
3. Navigate to a specific day: `cd day_1` or `cd day_2`
4. Run the solution: `cargo run`

Feel free to explore the solutions, and if you have any suggestions or improvements, don't hesitate to open an issue or submit a pull request.

Happy coding!
